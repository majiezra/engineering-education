pygame is a cross-platform collection of Python tools used for creating video games. It provides sound and graphics libraries for use with the Python programming language.

Pygame makes use of the Simple DirectMedia Layer (SDL) library, which was designed to make real-time computer game production easier by eliminating the low-level mechanics of C programming and its variants. This is based on the notion that the most expensive functions in games can be abstracted from the game logic, allowing the game to be structured using a high-level programming language such as Python.

SDL's other features include vector math, collision detection, 2D sprite scene graph management, MIDI support, camera, pixel-array manipulation, transformations, filtering, advanced freetype font support, and drawing. SDL allows you to use any platform to access your system's multimedia hardware, such as sound, video, a mouse, keyboard, and a joystick.

Because SDL and pygame are cross-platform, you can use them to create games and rich multimedia Python programs for any platform that supports them.
Because of Pygame Subset for Android, Pygame applications can run on Android phones and tablets. Android includes support for sound, vibration, a keyboard, and an accelerometer.

### Prerequisites

You'll need the following items to follow along with this tutorial:
[python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed,
A Python-oriented code editor. I use [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/).
You can learn more about graphic user interfaces by reading my previous article on [section](https://www.section.io/engineering-education/introduction-to-gui-in-python-using-tkinter/)
Pygame is compatible with all versions of Python, however Python 3.6 is suggested and utilized in this article.

Python must be installed before pygame can be used. When you install Python, you get Tkinter as well. 
However, you can use the `pip` command to install it if you don't have it.

```python
 
Pip install pygame
```

### What is Tkinter?

Tkinter has a number of advantages when it comes to creating graphical user interfaces. Python is a cross-platform language, therefore Tkinter programs can run on Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux.
Tkinter applications appear to be native to the instance on which they are running. This is the situation because the visual components are built utilizing native system programs.

### Os module

 We don't need to install this module because it's included in the Python standard library. The Operating System provides a variety of capabilities for interacting with it. In this tutorial, we'll use OS to retrieve a playlist of songs from a certain directory and make it available to the music player.

### Graphic user interface

 In contrast to text-based user links, typed commands, or text exploration, a graphical user interface (GUI) allows users to interact with electronic symbols. Command-line networks have a steep learning curve and need command input via a computer keyboard, hence GUIs were created in response.

### Creating a music player

Create a new file named `musicgui.py` where we will write our code
Letâ€™s start by importing `pygame`

```python
import pygame
import tkinter as tkr
from tkinter.filedialog import askdirectory
import os
```

The `tkinter module` gives the user access to the Tkinter widgets. Because it is included in the Python standard library, the `os module`, which is an Operating System with a variety of features for dealing with it, and it does not need to be installed.

```python
music_player = tkr.Tk()
music_player.title("My Music Player")
music_player.geometry("450x350")
directory = askdirectory()
os.chdir(directory)
song_list = os.listdir()
```

A root window is created using the `tk` class.
Tkinter provides many methods, including the `geometry ()` method. We use it to determine the size of the music player.
The `askdirectroy ()` function allows the music player to access the user's music file.

```python
play_list = tkr.Listbox(music_player, font="Helvetica 10 bold", bg='yellow', selectmode=tkr.SINGLE)
for item in song_list:
   pos = 0
   play_list.insert(pos, item)
   pos += 1
pygame.init()
pygame.mixer.init()
```

The play list variable defines the `tkr.Listbox` widget, which shows a group of lines of text that influences the backdrop color and font of the music player.
The `pygame.mixer.init()` function is used to load and play sounds, as well as control the rate at which they are played.

```python
def play():
   pygame.mixer.music.load(play_list.get(tkr.ACTIVE))
   var.set(play_list.get(tkr.ACTIVE))
   pygame.mixer.music.play()
def stop():
   pygame.mixer.music.stop()
def pause():
   pygame.mixer.music.pause()
def unpause():
   pygame.mixer.music.unpause()
Button1 = tkr.Button(music_player, width=4, height=2, font="Helvetica 10 bold", text="PLAY", command=play, bg="blue", fg="white")
Button2 = tkr.Button(music_player, width=4, height=2, font="Helvetica 10 bold", text="STOP", command=stop, bg="red", fg="white")
Button3 = tkr.Button(music_player, width=4, height=2, font="Helvetica 10 bold", text="PAUSE", command=pause, bg="purple", fg="white")
Button4 = tkr.Button(music_player, width=4, height=2, font="Helvetica 10 bold", text="UNPAUSE", command=unpause, bg="orange", fg="white")
var = tkr.StringVar()
song_title = tkr.Label(music_player, font="Helvetica 10 bold", textvariable=var)
```

The `pygame.mixer.music.load` function was used to start the GUI, the `stop` function to stop the music, the `pause` function to pause the music player, and the `unpause` method to undo the pause key's action. We also specify the functions of the buttons/keypads that are associated with these functions, such as keypad height, font sizes, and functionalities.

```python
song_title.pack()
Button1.pack(fill="x")
Button2.pack(fill="x")
Button3.pack(fill="x")
Button4.pack(fill="x")
play_list.pack(fill="both", expand="yes")
music_player.mainloop()
```

The`.pack()` method checks to see if the widget takes up any extra space that the packer has allotted to it. When `"x"` is used, the widget can only be filled horizontally.

You've finished your first Tkinter application, which is fantastic!

### Conclusion

In this tutorial, We covered some fundamentals of the Tkinter GUI, and we built a password generator application in Python using Tkinter. You can find the code on github.
